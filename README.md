# rebuild-PCA
Using python sklearn library, I tried to find PCA parameters of some pictures from MNIST for (a) all pictues together and (b) for each picture for itself and rebuild them by that parameters.
We can see the decreasing in rebuild error for both methods, and also obvious decrease of rebuild error and clarity of the rebuilt picture in part (b) especially in low number of parameters.
